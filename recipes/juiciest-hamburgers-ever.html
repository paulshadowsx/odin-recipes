        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>No more dry, lackluster hamburgers. These are juicy, and spices can
           be easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste. If you find the
           meat mixture too mushy, just add more bread crumbs until it forms
           patties that hold their shape.</p>
        <p>This aptly named hamburger recipe uses evaporated milk, eggs, and
           bread crumbs to create incredibly juicy and flavorful hamburger
           patties that will rival your favorite burger joint.</p>
